Scope is defined as the area of a script in which code can be read or accessed. There are terms used to further define what the scope of a variable or function is, such as “public” and “private”. “Public” indicates that the code can be read from anywhere in the script or project (given the correct call method), while “private” indicates that it can only be used in that particular block or script. A block is generally defined by what is inside open and closed curly brackets. Variables and functions are automatically assigned a scope of private unless otherwise specified.
