If statements are a very simple way of setting up a conditional statement. Similar to a bool, an if statement requires a “true/false” condition to run, but can use variables instead of simply “true/false”, like in a bool. If a condition is met, like “variable >= variable”, then the if statement will run. Switch statements are like a group of if statements, and are a shorter and more streamlined way of setting up conditionals.
